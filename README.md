Hello! This repo is still under active development so its exact end-form has not been determined yet. But in its current state, given a Twilio client sid and key, this program can send (1) random xkcd comics to a specified number or (2) send current cryptocurrency prices to a specified number on a regular basis.

This project currently uses Twilio's sms/mms API and a webscraping library called BeautifulSoup as well as https://xkcd.com/ and https://coinranking.com/ as source websites.
